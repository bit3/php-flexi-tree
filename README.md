FlexiTree is a framework, similar to [KnpMenu](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpMenu) to create navigation menus with PHP.
There are some commonalities, but also a lot of differences.

* FlexiTree force a OO-only interface.
* FlexiTree is as lightweight as possible, but also as flexible as possible.
* FlexiTree menus are designed to be fully stateless.
